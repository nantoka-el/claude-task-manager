## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Use async/await over callbacks
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Commits
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep commits atomic (one feature/fix per commit)

Example:
```
Fix: XSS vulnerability in task viewer
Add: Windows support for CLI tool
Update: Search performance with JSON index
```
